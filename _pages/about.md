## Hello, my name is Aleksandra!

I am a second year doctoral student at the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w, Poland. I am currently working on my PhD thesis about the stylometry of machine translation, and in particular about finding new ways of distinguishing human and machine translation based on the linguistic features of the texts.

My main research interests of course include stylometry of literary texts (prose, as well as poetry), machine translation, stereotypes hidden in automatically generated texts, versology and corpus linguistics.
