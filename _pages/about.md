I am on the second year of my PhD studies at the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w, Poland. I am currently working on my PhD thesis regarding the stylometry of machine translation, in particular about finding new ways of distinguishing human and machine translation based on the linguistic features of the texts.

My main research interests obviously include stylometry of literary texts (prose as well as poetry), machine translation, stereotypes hidden in automatically generated texts, versology, and corpus linguistics.
